My name is Sven Boulanger, and I'm a Belgian with a wide range of interests. I'm an electronics engineer by trade, more specifically an analog designer with emphasis on silicon and CMOS opto-electronics, device physics.

My other hobbies are - among others - programming, playing badminton, playing music and woodworking. I like finding myself absorbed learning new things.
